There are "//TODO"s for most of these

PigGUI - Make player namecards load dynamically (using boxlayout probably, instead of using the "grid" variable)
PigGUI - Make setOrder() remove player namecards and put them back in the given order.
PigGUI - Improve display of roll record (the lists of what each player rolled)
PigGUI - Create roll animation of some sort. 3D or 2D. (not imperative, kind of optional)

TESTING
- Test multiplayer
- create JUnitTest test classes for each component as applicable

OTHER:
From announcement - "Please include a file that has each team member's name and their associated GitHub ID."

IN PROGRESS:
Priyanka : PigEngine - Shuffle player order (create int[] containing 0 through n-1 nonrepeating in a random order)
